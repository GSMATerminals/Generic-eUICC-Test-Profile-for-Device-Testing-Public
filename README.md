# Generic-eUICC-Test-Profile-for-Device-Testing-Public
The introduction of Devices with non-removable UICC presents a need to review best practice for testing. System simulator-based 
Device testing for industry certification schemes such as GCF and PTCRB has traditionally expected the necessary test profiles
to be made available via removable test UICCs. As industry moves towards non-removable (embedded) UICC, the common way of testing
Devices becomes less clear. The opportunity therefore exists to normalize the way in which Test Profiles for embedded UICCs will be
available, and configurable, for industry standardised testing.
